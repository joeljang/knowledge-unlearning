He took another step, but he was still in the glen",lambada

Todd looked back again, this time he realized it really was Enoch; Todd stopped on the side of the road, leaned back and tried to see if he was dreaming.

2,172,"He was small, even for a dwarf, and his poor taste in sorcerous robes contrasted awkwardly with D’jebee’s elegant attire; her long, diaphanous gown and his chemical-stained, star-spangled robe clashed almost as much as her vacuous expression alongside his own visage, alive as it was with cunning and a twisted intelligence.

D’jebee sighed with boredom.

‘What is it, my love?’ Poldanyelz oozed with ersatz concern.

‘I’m bored,’ D’jebee complained undiplomatically. ‘No one ever comes here. I never see anyone except you.’

A shuffling from the main arch alerted her to the inaccuracy of her statement",lambada

Lucy gulped and Gillian began to open her mouth to protest again, but the Librarian carried on regardless, his voice becoming louder in order to drown out any potentially dissenting voices, “... blah, blah, blah.  It is our recommendation that a downsizing of the non-essential and part-time members of staff would bring instant economy of scale benefits and would allow for the implementation of a new middle management structure.”

5,159,"There had been himself, Gillian Dawson, the assistant librarian in charge of acquisitions, Chege Gomez, who did something unspecific in the archive section, and a new employee whose name Art had yet to discover, but who turned out to be called Lucy something and who stacked shelves and ran various errands for the deputy librarian, all nervously seated around in a circle, in the surprisingly comfortable chairs in the Librarian’s spacious office, awaiting the arrival of the Main Man.  The delay allowed plenty of time for idle speculation.
“What do you think he wants?” asked Chege, fidgeting nervously in his chair like a cat on hot bricks.

Not only is it a communication device, but it can also be dropped as a distraction, scented with various perfumes and noxious gases for discombobulation, used to wipe the forehead of a gentleman, or even bandage a wound, and, of course, you may dab at the eyes or nose if it is still clean",lambada

Mills started from the midst of the group—dark spots under his arms marked where the perspiration had soaked into his shirt.
""None of us know how we got here,"" Ray explained, taking on a leadership role.  He had, after all, saved John Henry's life, so, although he was younger than John Henry, he had a certain serendipitous good fortune going for him which plucked him out to be leader",lambada

Someone honked the horn and Jet pulled away. He left a little bite to remember him by and now, instead of being angry, those oh-so-pretty eyes with that gold halo just looked sad.

Like some other people...

As she gathered up her papers and retreated to her attic, Alice wondered again how she could have been so wrong about Ella. Of all her friends, she would never have expected her to be the one to let her down-Cassie, in an episode of single-minded selfishness, perhaps; Flora, out of thoughtlessness; but Ella",lambada

THE FIRST NIGHT IT HAPPENED

The first night it happened, I followed them into the strip mall parking lot. They were all stuffed into a silver-gray Honda-all thousand of them. This was back in November. Charlie had only been dead two months then.

One minute I was sitting on the side of a country road, taking shots of Smirnoff and counting my tips before I went back to the store to close, the next minute I was in the middle of a science fiction movie, complete with a jet-powered Honda Civic and a thousand translucent zombielike beings who looked like Charlie",lambada

Conversation stopped when she and Dillon re-entered the living room, and once again there was open speculation on the faces of the Colters.

Seth's gaze dropped to her and Dillon's linked hands. His expression remained neutral, but his eyes told a different story. There was uncertainty there, and forgetting that Dillon was going to inform him that she was taking a ride with him, she dropped Dillon's hand and went straight to Seth",lambada

The crates were dragged inside and deposited in the wide hallway so that each class could troop out in turn, grab a bottle and return to their desks to drink it.

There's rocks surrounding the area and Aiden rolls the largest rock out of the way, revealing a cave nestled behind it. I carry Maci inside.

Lady Maccon looked her up and down, emitting a lip curl that was, quite frankly, remarkably Felicity-like. Sometimes, although not too often, there came an indication that they were, indeed, related",lambada

Mary took Nell’s hands. ‘You’re frozen. Tell me what’s wrong, Nell.’

Peter opened his mouth to speak and as his tongue touched the roof of his mouth to make an utterance, Simon's consciousness flashed to the infirmary again.

Jase is silent, but I can see him stealing glances at me from the corner of his eye as he drives",lambada

""I can't believe someone with all your loot's eating that slop,"" said Jas",lambada

'Here it is,' said Margaret. 'Hello?' she called, and knocked tentatively, unsure if she would be heard above the din. 'Is Dennis there?'

I didn't mean to pounce on her.

""Too right, there's a pattern",lambada

Throughout the next day, I wracked my brain trying to figure out why the scent of my attacker seemed familiar. I knew I'd smelled it before, but I just couldn't identify it. It was like that elusive word stuck on the tip of your tongue. It's there, but you just can't get to it. I'd thought about her on and off all day, my attacker",lambada
2446,82,"I disagree and pointed out our best chance of getting her agreement was if we could offer her a suitable alternative. Perhaps if we were able to fool another vampire into vacating his or her own body Valesca might choose their instead. That however created its’ very own list of issues that we would need to overcome.

He splashed a bit more brandy into his glass. There were a hundred reasons why he did not go back to Ireland. Fifty, at least.

There was one reason he did not go back to Ireland",lambada

Dawn grabbed him as he tried to run away and brought him to Chaiko",lambada

Wally lifted his right hand and pointed at the stage",lambada

But in the years she'd known them, she had gotten used to having their experiences and knowledge at hand.  Trying to research the mysterious creature in the woods by herself was a tedious process.

Carter broke the kiss and sat up straight. Beyond Carter's broad body, Max stared at me with a scowl on his face. He turned back to the movie screen and didn't look at me again. I was so preoccupied by what Max's scowl had meant that I couldn't focus on the rest of the movie",lambada

He paused.
""I can't think of any,"" Bok said.

""Bok, why have one billion Omanji decided not to merge",lambada
3313,77,"""Logan said they were on the way to a friend of the family's house. That was why they were in Virginia. Did she have any friends who lived in Virginia?""

""No, not that I know of,"" he answered.

""Freak,"" Vee choked. ""You saw him nak*d? Where did it happen? His Jeep? His house? Your bedroom?""

3317,77,"How Gavan had swung getting Dylan into the ring against him, Spike didn't know. But if Dylan went down under Spike, that would send a signal to Shiftertown that the Morrisseys could lose strength.

Out of the corner of his eye, Spike saw Connor Morrissey approach Myka. Gavan shot Connor a suspicious look then moved his focus back to the ring",lambada
3318,77,"I immediately jumped into action before the arguments could start. I produced Tatiana's note, reading it aloud and then letting Dimitri look at it. I told them about my ghostly encounter, where the queen's troubled spirit made me believe there was truth to this. Nonetheless, my companions were skeptical.

""You have no proof Tatiana wrote the note,' said Dimitri",lambada

Epilogue Two Nights Later

TRENT

From high above, perched on the thick branch of a tree, I watched the cars below passed by. They were the only things on the streets at the moment. It was nights like these that I wished something would happen. It was too quiet, too peaceful, too… boring",lambada
3321,77,"""I got over it, Neely, finally.""

""Maybe I haven't.""

""Oh get a life! And grow up while you're at it. You're not the football hero anymore.""

""Did you come here to fight, Neely",lambada

'Thank you,' said a fat ballerina. '-so she thought, how could people still say afterwards that they'd seen the Ghost? 'Cos that's how you recognize the Ghost, by his mask",lambada
3323,77,"Loras chose his companions fairly, even when he wanted to take Farah with him. I have no complaints about the process though it left me marching in the rain. Farah pulls up her hood to keep out the damp, and the rest of us follow suit. Vel takes point with the rest of us in twos. Z ends up beside me, Xirol with Farah",lambada
3324,77,"It's the same one I get right before I open a can of whup-ass on Remi.""

Aimee ground her teeth in frustration, but Dev was right. She knew that look intimately and had worn it a time or two herself. ""Papa always breaks you guys up.""

""Yeah, and if they go too far, I will too",lambada
3325,77,"I'm sorry; I thought I could get her into the corral without waking you.""

""Thanks for the warning. How will you get her into the corral",lambada
3326,77,"A rustle from the direction of Hannah Frobisher caught John’s attention and he glanced at her. Her eyes were now even wider at the mention that John might be ‘immensely’ old.
John refused to give Peterson the satisfaction of agreeing that he was right.  He shrugged wearily. “So what do you want from me, Peterson",lambada
3327,77,"""Would it be wrong to wear pajamas to a guard meeting?""

""It would be inappropriate,"" Ethan said. ""But I think you're more than excused from leathers or a suit tonight.""

""You're dating the Master of the House.""

I took that as a ""no"" on the sweatpants",lambada
3328,77,"My gaze locked onto the artifact case that Alexei had been looking at earlier-the one with two swords in it.

A Reaper broke away from the circle around Oliver and Alexei and rushed toward me. I waited until the figure was in range, then spun around him and ran toward the artifact case.

I skidded to a halt in front of the case",lambada
3329,77,"Ellen loves to knit and she's already taught three of her friends. Her teacher was so impressed she thought it might be a good idea for the whole class to learn.""

Evelyn nodded approvingly. ""Ellen's teacher mentioned that to me. She said knitting will help the children with math concepts and learning patience. It'll also give them a sense of achievement",lambada
3330,77,"Ana didn’t really know how to answer the question. She was supposed to give a positive response according to customs, but it wouldn’t be the truth. Now that Vo was standing in front of her, she realized just how much she had wanted him and missed him all this time. 
“I can’t complain,” said Ana",lambada

I rolled my eyes.

""He's being terrible to Rule and Shaw, and I'm not going to just watch.""

""That's a family matter. Rule can fight his own battles, and he isn't going to let anything happen to Shaw",lambada
3332,77,"After today, when the bus delivered Carter to his home, it was unlikely he'd ever see Rusty again. Carter couldn't bear to have that happen, but he had to prepare himself for disappointment.

Because it was the last day before winter break, school was dismissed an hour early. While Carter lined up with his friends for bus number seven, he scanned the area for Rusty",lambada
3333,77,"Sarah says sweetly, acting like she had simply forgotten to tell him at some point.

Obviously, it was better that he hadn't known.

""Is there no hope for you and Andre",lambada

“Stay out of this, Claire. You’ve had nothing to do with the boys all their lives; don’t start playing Auntie now; it doesn’t suit you.”
“It suits me better than father suits you. When did you become such a monster, Robert",lambada
3336,77,"But how would she ever pull it off?
Andy looked more confused than anything else. He seemed more upset about his sisters’ crying. Abby wondered how much he knew or how much he could comprehend. 
Abby looked at Lizzie and saw that she was actually not crying. She was holding on to Abby like the others, but she wasn’t crying",lambada
3337,77,"‘This is Penmel’s initiative, not mine. Besides, it doesn’t say anything dangerous. We are perfectly safe,’ Gadreel answered.
‘You are a quick study. I had better watch you. This is great work!’ Helel embraced him fiercely. ‘You are my right hand, Gadreel",lambada

“Mom, she works there,” said Vo. “Ana is a photographer during the day. She won a contest recently.”
“Did you major in photography in college?” said Lan.
“I didn’t go to college,” said Ana",lambada
3339,77,"Blinking her eyes, he saw herself in a grey room that was grey all around. He saw with annoyance that standing watching was the Keos’ Queen with her arms folded and her black eyes were narrowed. She he saw in her mind sensed a flash of light as Geelley came into the room from the opening. He saw she looked before resuming looking at the Queen",lambada

""Thank you, Father,"" said Viktor.

""Now, it's almost dawn. I want you safely in the cellars.""

""But why? Why must we be in the cellars now?"" Viktor asked. He obviously didn't like the idea of being in a cellar",lambada
3341,77,"Then Ananda added, “And when you stop to think about it, miracles are as natural as anything, they obey laws, too, only that we are not yet privy to them.”
To Ananda’s mild astonishment—or perhaps not so mild—Melissa seemed to understand. No, there was no seemed about it, she did understand",lambada

He looked at me as he dragged over the pile of wood shingles. ""Honestly?""

""Yeah,"" I said, reaching for a shingle",lambada

Dominic took her hands, and his touch was so strong, so warm. ""Go ahead,"" he said softly. ""I'm listening.""

She looked up into his eyes, praying her words would come out right. ""I've been in love with you for a long time, Dominic",lambada
3345,77,"Rachel was proud of herself for staying calm, speaking like a sane adult, and not slapping him again. How had she been so attracted to this jerk two months earlier? He radiated command as if it were a part of his skin, and she couldn't stand men who thought they were lord and ruler of everything around them.

""I don't think you understand, Rachel",lambada
3346,77,"He pushed himself up and they all stood together one last time.
“Take one water skin each. You can refill it out of the river so you don’t need to carry anything else but food.”
“What about the tent?” Connor asked.
“The next time you close your eyes you won’t need a tent",lambada
3347,77,"At that very moment, while Miranda's heart was still between beats, Valentine strode into the hall. She had no time to be glad as their glances met and she knew he had felt her distress and come despite his own heartache.
""You've arrived just in time."" Simon spoke brusquely as he looked at the note, looked at Miranda, looked at Valentine",lambada
3348,77,"Keith had passed over twenty years on earth since Horatius had last seen him. The Highlander’s hair had thinned and lost its color, letting his red scalp show through the thin white strands that were left. His head and nose had thickened, and his ears hung low and large. 
Horatius slid onto a high-backed carved chair across from Keith",lambada
3349,77,Juan was perspiring. Adrian was biting her lower lip. Adrian’s mother and father appeared to be statues. I didn’t think they would come. Juan’s parents were beaming. They always loved Adrian and were eager to make her an official part of the family. Too bad Adrian’s parents didn’t feel the same about Juan,lambada

traps beware of traps
I stand stock still in the snow, looking around. How would I be able to tell if there was a trap",lambada
3355,77,"Elinor sat stiffly on his lap, trying to think of something witty to say to that. Something biting.
But her heart still pounded and she imagined her townhouse without him here waiting for her and she just couldn’t think of anything.

3357,77,He was still reeling from losing the connection with the boy. A few more seconds and they would have been joined. His power along with the boy’s control over the Amulet of Rhol would have made things much simpler. They...he would have been unstoppable. The boy was still not out of his reach. Solharn was confident that he was getting to the boy,lambada
3358,77,"""We do not need his help,"" said Solovet dismissively.

""You don't think you need anyone's help. It would serve you right if we all left you here to rot in the jungle, Solovet,"" said Lapblood.

The nurse smiled and took the delivery scrip.  ""Sure."" She pawed around her desk for an ink pen but only found pencils.  Shrugging, she used the gold fountain pen and signed her name.  ""That's funny,"" she said, shaking it, ""no ink",lambada

Annie couldn't deal with this now. It was enough to realize that the past year had been a lie; she couldn't fathom the possibility that Blake had become a complete stranger. She stared at Terri, hoping her friend could understand. ""You're asking me to be someone I'm not, Terri",lambada

Ramsey pulled her out onto the dance floor. She was a good dancer, clearly trained in some way.

I wanted to wipe that self-confident smirk off her face, but I knew it was true. The idea of watching her die didn't sit well with me. Why? She's the original vampire's daughter. She's most likely made of pure wickedness. Why wouldn't I want to see her die",lambada

""Yes. Sure."" She stepped back and Colt slipped past her. He carried both babies into the living room, set them down with their toys, then came back to her. She couldn't look away from him. She was half afraid that if she did, he might disappear",lambada

Earlier, I was curious why Tori didn't want me wearing jeans and a T-shirt tonight. She insisted that I wear her little black cocktail dress, the one she reserves for special occasions. That right there should've been a huge red flag.

Jack glanced at me before turning to face his future bride. ""She came to see me. She wanted to talk.""

""She's trying to stop the wedding, isn't she? She doesn't want us to be together, Jack",lambada
4415,71,"I pulled on my brown boots on over the skinny jeans.

Expecting to hear my phone again, I couldn't place the noise at first. It was the doorbell. Someone was buzzing me from downstairs. Liz must be here after all. I jogged to the door and punched the call button. ""Be down in a sec, Liz",lambada

I looked back at him meaningfully. ""Well?""

""Well, what?""

""Don't make me spell it out. I'm in this dress, and I don't want to be alone. Come inside with me. You owe me a dance, you know.""

""And you know I don't dance",lambada
4417,71,"They both turned to look at her and love shone in their weathered expressions. Ethan came to stand beside where she sat on the barstool and wrapped an arm around her shoulders. He squeezed and she leaned her head against his shoulder.

""We're glad you're home too. We always miss you when you're gone, and we worry",lambada
4418,71,"He put his hands on the roof and tried to think where she might be. Had she said something once? A clue?
A zombie stumbled across the road about half a mile ahead, followed by another, and another. They seemed to be heading in one direction.
Chris got in the car, floored the strategy and followed the trail of zombies",lambada
4419,71,"""A supersmart hot girl who reads comics? Are you kidding? You were definitely on my radar.""

Hot. I've been upgraded to hot. No one has ever called me hot. Cute? Yes. Adorable? Yes, often, and it makes me want to punch them. I didn't know short girls could even be hot",lambada
4420,71,"My mom and Lou are right downstairs. I haven't told her about Caleb. I wanted to. To be honest, I've been stalling because the last thing I want to do is upset her when she's still trying to figure things out with my dad and Lou.

It's time I confess to my mom the truth about me and Caleb",lambada
4421,71,"""Stay,"" he ordered, and then climbed out of the Jeep with an agility that made her envious. She watched him jog around the front of the car and then come to her side, opening the door. Extending an arm, he wiggled his fingers playfully.

Taking his hand, she let him pull her from the Jeep",lambada
4422,71,"I'm the guy that will be around forever.

Mrs. Rowe yanks the placeholder off the seat next to me and plops down. ""Are you nervous?""

I glance at her in response and rub my hands together. It's scary how much I want this. It's even more terrifying to think what happens if I do win",lambada

""That's genius."" Why hadn't she thought of anything this remarkable? ""I'm serious. This adds a vital layer of protection for your clients. One more reason people should hire bodyguards from Soren Security instead of the competition",lambada
4424,71,"The one thing Fang couldn't stomach was to see a woman threatened, never mind harmed.

Any creature cowardly enough to prey on a woman deserved the most brutal death imaginable. And if it was delivered to him by Fang's hand, then all the better.

Shrugging his jacket on, he picked up his plate and returned to eating",lambada
4425,71,"The four of them looked at the fragile old woman skeptically.
“Let us take a hike on one of the beginner trails,” Ami suggested.  “It's good for my old bones to get out and about and these mineral springs are wonderfully rejuvenating.”
They did as Ami suggested and took a hike",lambada
4426,71,"she asked warily, steering the conversation back to her main concern. It wasn't like her to be sidetracked by a good-looking man-which made this one all the more dangerous.

""A friend of mine sent me here. He attended one of your dance classes last year. Your name is too unique for me to be mistaken",lambada
4427,71,"He handed the phone over to Samantha.

""I see Blake's being his usual talkative self,"" Erica mused down the line. She didn't wait for Samantha to agree. ""I heard about your accident and just wanted to see how you were doing.""

Samantha appreciated her concern. ""I'm fine, thanks, Erica",lambada
4428,71,"""Professor,"" Sato said suddenly, glancing up from her BlackBerry, ""despite your insistence that you have no idea why you're here tonight, perhaps you could shed light on the meaning of Peter Solomon's ring.""

""A new name?  I can't just change my name,"" Ann said doubtfully.  
""Not entirely a new name.  I just want you to go by your initials.  'AJ' for Ann Jones.  AJ has a much more memorable ring to it than Ann",lambada

""No, Stephanie. If you had heard them, which I did, then you'd agree with me. They can't leave there. If they do, they'll tear apart the world. We have to leave them there and hope that time brings some sense into their heads,"" said Phillip",lambada

""Then I say, let 'er rip,"" Elise said. She raised her sensibly shod foot and stomped on a bubble. A popping sound exploded in the room.

Barbie went next, her step firm. Her high heels effectively demolished a series of bubbles",lambada
4432,71,"Mack sighed, dusted off his hands, and swung his legs to the floor. ""Mia, don't do this. You're a smart young woman, and I am an extremely well-trained man. If I wasn't, why would King trust your safety to me?""

""I just want to go to the gym, Mack",lambada
4433,71,"""But if that's what you need, I'll do it. Do you understand? I'll do anything you need me to do. Because I have never felt like this about anything, and I'm terrified of screwing up and losing it.""

4434,71,We sat in the kitchen and ate dinner.  It was the last day Amara and Emily would be together. The next morning we were going to a small town that Sariel thought would be safe. We didn’t know for how long but we all hoped it would be short. Amara was trying to be strong and so was Emily,lambada
4435,71,"Your shoulder – where are your clothes?”
Yeah – you forgot that part, right? But nope. That was me, new zombie, no clothes.
So what else could I do but reach out, grab my landlord, pull him in, and start chewing.
Yeah. Sorry about this, but man, he was simply delicious",lambada
4436,71,"“Yeah right. Like we’d waste our time with that flea bag.”
I stepped between them and the cat. Scott and I had known each other since elementary school, and if I knew one thing about him, it was how to tell when he was lying. “This is low, even for you, Scott",lambada
4437,71,"Adam Shaw placed another pack of explosives into the stone cutout in the tunnel. Where to go next? He should have made a map back to the museum lobby; the tunnels were never-ending. Somewhere in the distance, he heard footsteps. He clicked his lantern off.

He receded deeper into the burial chamber that lay just off the tunnel",lambada
4438,70,"Recall our encounter with the warbirds at the Federation border. Confirm my memory with yours.”
She turned Seren to face her. They placed their foreheads together as when they meditated together. They held hands beneath the surface of the water. They closed their eyes.
“There were five warbirds at the border",lambada
4439,70,"the boy said, looking proud of every word.
""Go on, James,"" the boy behind him said. Some of the other boys had already headed into the showers and James had been too busy warning Toby. James gave Toby a long dark look then turned and walked on. A moment later Toby followed the boy in front of him into the showers",lambada
4440,70,"His gentle voice did me in. Tears seeped from my eyes. I had to make them stop. Big, bad werewolf hunters did not cry. Petite, blond girlie-girls did. They also got their families murdered before their eyes while powerless to do anything about it. I was no longer that girl; I was the hunter",lambada
4441,70,"We'd just wake up and have TV marathons until we passed out.

Neither of us was getting much sleep, but we were closer than ever. It took a few days for her to start laughing again, but I'd catch her texting on her phone and smiling. It didn't take a genius to figure out who she was texting",lambada
4442,70,"Remember that certain child celebrity who had a penchant for coc**ne and Botox injections? You don't see her at the club scenes anymore, and she's now working in Hollywood again. So I have experience with overgrown children who don't care how their actions affect other people. I have built a career on repairing images of those in the spotlight",lambada
4443,70,"She didn't get that he called her name for the very first time. Until now, he had called her Decima. Julia was sure he mixed up the names without purpose. He was in pain, in fever, he was wounded and therefore confused and excused. However, he noticed the change just in the moment he spoke out her name aloud",lambada
4444,70,"I think my family's figured out which world I ran away to and they're probably coming to get me.  But I don't want to go!  I like being out on my own.  There are more than enough of us to bring the storms.""

4449,70,"The night we were almost together will come rushing back. I can't do it.

Peter cuts his gaze from Trevor and takes in my reaction. ""We should stick to the basics. Advanced moves are very challenging. A novice would have issues and we don't want to single anyone out. Now-""

""I'm not a novice",lambada
4450,70,"Surely Archie had to see that Cass was going to die if this continued. Lara may have started to see some sense in his theory, but that didn't mean it was all correct.
""Watch."" He whispered. She turned her head to look at Cass. Her screams were becoming deafening. Her throat sounded rough, but she still screamed",lambada
4451,70,"Between losing Pandora and Luxa, whom he'd only just found, really, and the responsibility of a kingdom hanging over him - he was clearly overwhelmed. ""I do not know what to do. Andromeda, what say you?""

""I will not fight the Overlander and risk injuring him. I am taking Mareth home,"" said Andromeda",lambada
4452,70,"That was all she knew. Wherever she went from here, it would be as a middle-aged woman alone.

4455,70,"""Are you sure you want to do this?"" His piercing blue eyes had just as much pain in them as I felt.

""Pour them,"" I responded.

4456,70,"One day the Master came around and saw a group of people staring at the icon, exclaiming, ‘It is the very image of Ainênia herself, and her blessed child!’ but Calibur was unaware of them, bending in rapt concentration as he added the halo. ‘It is ready,’ said the master",lambada
4457,70,"His grin widened. ""I was fairly certain someone would try to follow us. I have been giving it quite a bit of thought as we walked, working out a plan.""

Ivory's amber gaze narrowed as it drifted over his face. He looked younger. Happier. She had done that but ...

""Trust me, Ivory",lambada

""No more. You sleep.""

Wait, what?
“Emily, how come you have a hood",lambada
4461,70,"You have to work at it, like anything else.”
Fiona’s words surprised Claire. Ruth always makes out like being a Mother is the most natural thing. How she wanted kids more than anything and loved Sky from the minute she popped screaming into the world. 
“How did you know you were ready for kids",lambada
4462,70,"It was sobering to realize that the most accurate perception of dinosaurs had also been the first. Back in the 1840s, when Richard Owen first described giant bones in England, he named them Dinosauria: terrible lizards. That was still the most accurate description of these creatures, Malcolm thought. They were indeed like lizards, and they were terrible",lambada

""Dad hated it when I left the lights on,"" I tell him, casually moving my queen on the middle board forward, presenting her to Lord Loss's rook. ""Electricity bills don't pay themselves, you know. Your move.""

With these final words, Oisin turned his gaze to Ella",lambada

Rusty perked up. Her eyes lit up with a smile as Betty came over from the entrance and sat down next to the Director and her. She reached out and offered her hand to the Director",lambada
